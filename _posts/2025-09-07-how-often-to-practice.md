Consistency is key when learning guitar. Here are some guidelines for effective practice:

- Aim for at least 20â€“30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.
- Short, focused sessions are better than long, infrequent ones.
- Set specific goals for each practice session.
- Take breaks to avoid fatigue and keep motivation high.

## Making Practice Fun

Mix up your routine with new songs, techniques, and jam sessions. Remember, regular practice leads to steady improvement!
