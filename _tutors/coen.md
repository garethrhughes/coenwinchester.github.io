For the past nine years, they’ve dedicated themselves to helping others develop their skills and studies in tandem with 
their own tertiary education. Through experience both teaching and learning in several institutions across Sydney, Coen

recording and mixing, improvisation, even science and mathematics.

Each of Coen’s lessons are tailored to the progression, goals, and learning preference of the student. With a broad and 
versatile curriculum, students can pursue any mix of topics they like at their own pace. Coen understands that the most 
important part of progressing in any field is passion and will focus on cultivating that, making each step of the 
learning process more rewarding than the last.
